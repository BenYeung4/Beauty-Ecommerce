# Interactive Full-Stack Project: Project 02
Our group used everything weâ€™ve learned over the past six weeks to create a real-world Full-Stack application that we will be able to showcase to potential employers. Our team has designed and build an app using the MVC paradigm, we created our own server-side API, added user authentication, which connects to our database.

The Module lessons and Challenge assignments have reinforced the importance of quality coding standards as well as providing us the tools and foundations to be able to connect our Front-End to our Back-End while continuing to follow best practices.
