# Interactive Full-Stack Project: Project 02
Our group used what we’ve learned over the past six weeks as well as go back to previous lessons and technologies for reference 
and reinforce our skills. We developed to create a real-world Full-Stack application that we will be able to showcase to potential employers. Our team has designed and build an app using the MVC paradigm, we created our own server-side API, added user 
authentication, which connects to our database which lets us Create Read Update and Delete files.

The Module lessons and Challenge assignments have reinforced the importance of quality coding standards as well as providing 
us the tools and foundations to be able to connect our Front-End to our Back-End while continuing to follow best practices.
